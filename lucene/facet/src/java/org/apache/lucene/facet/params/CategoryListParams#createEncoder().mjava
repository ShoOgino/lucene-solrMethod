  /**
   * Allows to override how categories are encoded and decoded. A matching
   * {@link IntDecoder} is provided by the {@link IntEncoder}.
   * <p>
   * Default implementation creates a new Sorting(<b>Unique</b>(DGap)) encoder.
   * Uniqueness in this regard means when the same category appears twice in a
   * document, only one appearance would be encoded. This has effect on facet
   * counting results.
   * <p>
   * Some possible considerations when overriding may be:
   * <ul>
   * <li>an application "knows" that all categories are unique. So no need to
   * pass through the unique filter.</li>
   * <li>Another application might wish to count multiple occurrences of the
   * same category, or, use a faster encoding which will consume more space.</li>
   * </ul>
   * In any event when changing this value make sure you know what you are
   * doing, and test the results - e.g. counts, if the application is about
   * counting facets.
