   * Set the number of cache misses before an attempt is made to read the
   * entire taxonomy into the in-memory cache.
   * <P> 
   * LuceneTaxonomyWriter holds an in-memory cache of recently seen
   * categories to speed up operation. On each cache-miss, the on-disk index
   * needs to be consulted. When an existing taxonomy is opened, a lot of
   * slow disk reads like that are needed until the cache is filled, so it
   * is more efficient to read the entire taxonomy into memory at once.
   * We do this complete read after a certain number (defined by this method)
   * of cache misses.
   * <P>
   * If the number is set to <CODE>0</CODE>, the entire taxonomy is read
   * into the cache on first use, without fetching individual categories
   * first.
   * <P>
   * Note that if the memory cache of choice is limited in size, and cannot
   * hold the entire content of the on-disk taxonomy, then it is never
   * read in its entirety into the cache, regardless of the setting of this
   * method.
