  /**
   * Returns the size of a partition. <i>Partitions</i> allow you to divide
   * (hence, partition) the categories space into small sets to e.g. improve RAM
   * consumption during faceted search. For instance, {@code partitionSize=100K}
   * would mean that if your taxonomy index contains 420K categories, they will
   * be divided into 5 groups and at search time a {@link FacetArrays} will be
   * allocated at the size of the partition.
   * 
   * <p>
   * This is real advanced setting and should be changed with care. By default,
   * all categories are put in one partition. You should modify this setting if
   * you have really large taxonomies (e.g. 1M+ nodes).
