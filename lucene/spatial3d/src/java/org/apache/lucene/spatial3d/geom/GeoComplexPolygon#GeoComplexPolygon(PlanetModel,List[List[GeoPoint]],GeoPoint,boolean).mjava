   * Create a complex polygon from multiple lists of points, and a single point which is known to be in or out of
   * set.
   *@param planetModel is the planet model.
   *@param pointsList is the list of lists of edge points.  The edge points describe edges, and have an implied
   *  return boundary, so that N edges require N points.  These points have furthermore been filtered so that
   *  no adjacent points are identical (within the bounds of the definition used by this package).  It is assumed
   *  that no edges intersect, but the structure can contain both outer rings as well as holes.
   *@param testPoint is the point whose in/out of setness is known.
   *@param testPointInSet is true if the test point is considered "within" the polygon.
