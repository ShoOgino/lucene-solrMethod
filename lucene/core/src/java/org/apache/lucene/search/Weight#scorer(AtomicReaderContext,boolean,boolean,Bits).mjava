   * Returns a {@link Scorer} which scores documents in/out-of order according
   * to <code>scoreDocsInOrder</code>.
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE:</b> even if <code>scoreDocsInOrder</code> is false, it is
   * recommended to check whether the returned <code>Scorer</code> indeed scores
   * documents out of order (i.e., call {@link #scoresDocsOutOfOrder()}), as
   * some <code>Scorer</code> implementations will always return documents
   * in-order.<br>
   * <b>NOTE:</b> null can be returned if no documents will be scored by this
   * query.
   * 
   * @param context
   *          the {@link AtomicReaderContext} for which to return the {@link Scorer}.
   * @param scoreDocsInOrder
   *          specifies whether in-order scoring of documents is required. Note
   *          that if set to false (i.e., out-of-order scoring is required),
   *          this method can return whatever scoring mode it supports, as every
   *          in-order scorer is also an out-of-order one. However, an
   *          out-of-order scorer may not support {@link Scorer#nextDoc()}
   *          and/or {@link Scorer#advance(int)}, therefore it is recommended to
   *          request an in-order scorer if use of these methods is required.
   * @param topScorer
   *          if true, {@link Scorer#score(Collector)} will be called; if false,
   *          {@link Scorer#nextDoc()} and/or {@link Scorer#advance(int)} will
   *          be called.
   * @param acceptDocs
   *          Bits that represent the allowable docs to match (typically deleted docs
   *          but possibly filtering other documents)
   *          
   * @return a {@link Scorer} which scores documents in/out-of order.
   * @throws IOException if there is a low-level I/O error
