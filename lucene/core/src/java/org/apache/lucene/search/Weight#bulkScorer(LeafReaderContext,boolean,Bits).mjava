  /**
   * Optional method, to return a {@link BulkScorer} to
   * score the query and send hits to a {@link Collector}.
   * Only queries that have a different top-level approach
   * need to override this; the default implementation
   * pulls a normal {@link Scorer} and iterates and
   * collects the resulting hits.
   *
   * @param context
   *          the {@link org.apache.lucene.index.LeafReaderContext} for which to return the {@link Scorer}.
   * @param scoreDocsInOrder
   *          specifies whether in-order scoring of documents is required. Note
   *          that if set to false (i.e., out-of-order scoring is required),
   *          this method can return whatever scoring mode it supports, as every
   *          in-order scorer is also an out-of-order one. However, an
   *          out-of-order scorer may not support {@link Scorer#nextDoc()}
   *          and/or {@link Scorer#advance(int)}, therefore it is recommended to
   *          request an in-order scorer if use of these
   *          methods is required.
   * @param acceptDocs
   *          Bits that represent the allowable docs to match (typically deleted docs
   *          but possibly filtering other documents)
   *
   * @return a {@link BulkScorer} which scores documents and
   * passes them to a collector.
   * @throws IOException if there is a low-level I/O error
