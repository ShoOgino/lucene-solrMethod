  /**
   * Advances to the first beyond (see NOTE below) the current whose document
   * number is greater than or equal to <i>target</i>. Returns the current
   * document number or {@link #NO_MORE_DOCS} if there are no more docs in the
   * set.
   * <p>
   * Behaves as if written:
   * 
   * <pre>
   * int advance(int target) {
   *   int doc;
   *   while ((doc = nextDoc()) &lt; target) {
   *   }
   *   return doc;
   * }
   * </pre>
   * 
   * Some implementations are considerably more efficient than that.
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE:</b> when <code> target &le; current</code> implementations may opt
   * not to advance beyond their current {@link #docID()}.
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE:</b> this method may be called with {@link #NO_MORE_DOCS} for
   * efficiency by some Scorers. If your implementation cannot efficiently
   * determine that it should exhaust, it is recommended that you check for that
   * value in each call to this method.
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE:</b> after the iterator has exhausted you should not call this
   * method, as it may result in unpredicted behavior.
