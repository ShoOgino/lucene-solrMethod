     * in Lucene. This is faster when the filter accepts many documents.
     * However, when the filter is very sparse, it can be faster to execute the query+filter
     * as a conjunction in some cases.
     * 
     * The default implementation returns <code>true</code> if the first document accepted by the
     * filter is < 100.
