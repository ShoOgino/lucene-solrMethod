   * <p><b>NOTE</b>: The instances returned by this method
   * pre-allocate a full array of length
   * <code>numHits</code>.
   *
   * @param sort
   *          the sort criteria (SortFields).
   * @param numHits
   *          the number of results to collect.
   * @param fillFields
   *          specifies whether the actual field values should be returned on
   *          the results (FieldDoc).
   * @param trackDocScores
   *          specifies whether document scores should be tracked and set on the
   *          results. Note that if set to false, then the results' scores will
   *          be set to Float.NaN. Setting this to true affects performance, as
   *          it incurs the score computation on each competitive result.
   *          Therefore if document scores are not required by the application,
   *          it is recommended to set it to false.
   * @param trackMaxScore
   *          specifies whether the query's maxScore should be tracked and set
   *          on the resulting {@link TopDocs}. Note that if set to false,
   *          {@link TopDocs#getMaxScore()} returns Float.NaN. Setting this to
   *          true affects performance as it incurs the score computation on
   *          each result. Also, setting this true automatically sets
   *          <code>trackDocScores</code> to true as well.
   * @param docsScoredInOrder
   *          specifies whether documents are scored in doc Id order or not by
   *          the given {@link Scorer} in {@link LeafCollector#setScorer(Scorer)}.
   * @return a {@link TopFieldCollector} instance which will sort the results by
   *         the sort criteria.
   * @throws IOException if there is a low-level I/O error
