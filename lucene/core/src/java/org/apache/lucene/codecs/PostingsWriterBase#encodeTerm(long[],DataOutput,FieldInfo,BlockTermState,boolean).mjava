   * increases when a new term is consumed. {@code out} is used to write generic
   * bytes, which are not monotonic.
   *
   * NOTE: sometimes long[] might contain "don't care" values that are unused, e.g. 
   * the pointer to postings list may not be defined for some terms but is defined
   * for others, if it is designed to inline  some postings data in term dictionary.
   * In this case, the postings writer should always use the last value, so that each
   * element in metadata long[] remains monotonic.
