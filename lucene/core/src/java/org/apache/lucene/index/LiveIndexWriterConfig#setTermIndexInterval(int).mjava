  /**
   * Expert: set the interval between indexed terms. Large values cause less
   * memory to be used by IndexReader, but slow random-access to terms. Small
   * values cause more memory to be used by an IndexReader, and speed
   * random-access to terms.
   * <p>
   * This parameter determines the amount of computation required per query
   * term, regardless of the number of documents that contain that term. In
   * particular, it is the maximum number of other terms that must be scanned
   * before a term is located and its frequency and position information may be
   * processed. In a large index with user-entered query terms, query processing
   * time is likely to be dominated not by term lookup but rather by the
   * processing of frequency and positional data. In a small index or when many
   * uncommon query terms are generated (e.g., by wildcard queries) term lookup
   * may become a dominant cost.
   * <p>
   * In particular, <code>numUniqueTerms/interval</code> terms are read into
   * memory by an IndexReader, and, on average, <code>interval/2</code> terms
   * must be scanned for each random term access.
   * 
   * <p>
   * Takes effect immediately, but only applies to newly flushed/merged
   * segments.
   * 
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE:</b> This parameter does not apply to all PostingsFormat implementations,
   * including the default one in this release. It only makes sense for term indexes
   * that are implemented as a fixed gap between terms. For example, 
   * {@link Lucene41PostingsFormat} implements the term index instead based upon how
   * terms share prefixes. To configure its parameters (the minimum and maximum size
   * for a block), you would instead use  {@link Lucene41PostingsFormat#Lucene41PostingsFormat(int, int)}.
   * which can also be configured on a per-field basis:
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * //customize Lucene40PostingsFormat, passing minBlockSize=50, maxBlockSize=100
   * final PostingsFormat tweakedPostings = new Lucene41PostingsFormat(50, 100);
   * iwc.setCodec(new Lucene41Codec() {
   *   &#64;Override
   *   public PostingsFormat getPostingsFormatForField(String field) {
   *     if (field.equals("fieldWithTonsOfTerms"))
   *       return tweakedPostings;
   *     else
   *       return super.getPostingsFormatForField(field);
   *   }
   * });
   * </pre>
   * Note that other implementations may have their own parameters, or no parameters at all.
   *
