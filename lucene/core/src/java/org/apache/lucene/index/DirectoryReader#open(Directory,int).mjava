  /** Expert: Returns a IndexReader reading the index in the given
   *  Directory with the given termInfosIndexDivisor.
   * @param directory the index directory
   * @param termInfosIndexDivisor Subsamples which indexed
   *  terms are loaded into RAM. This has the same effect as {@link
   *  IndexWriterConfig#setTermIndexInterval} except that setting
   *  must be done at indexing time while this setting can be
   *  set per reader.  When set to N, then one in every
   *  N*termIndexInterval terms in the index is loaded into
   *  memory.  By setting this to a value > 1 you can reduce
   *  memory usage, at the expense of higher latency when
   *  loading a TermInfo.  The default value is 1.  Set this
   *  to -1 to skip loading the terms index entirely.
   *  <b>NOTE:</b> divisor settings &gt; 1 do not apply to all PostingsFormat
   *  implementations, including the default one in this release. It only makes
   *  sense for terms indexes that can efficiently re-sample terms at load time.
   * @throws IOException if there is a low-level IO error
