  /** <p>Expert: prepare for commit.  This does the
   *  first phase of 2-phase commit. This method does all
   *  steps necessary to commit changes since this writer
   *  was opened: flushes pending added and deleted docs,
   *  syncs the index files, writes most of next segments_N
   *  file.  After calling this you must call either {@link
   *  #commit()} to finish the commit, or {@link
   *  #rollback()} to revert the commit and undo all changes
   *  done since the writer was opened.</p>
   *
   * <p>You can also just call {@link #commit()} directly
   *  without prepareCommit first in which case that method
   *  will internally call prepareCommit.
