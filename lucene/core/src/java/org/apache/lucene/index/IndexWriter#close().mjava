  /**
   * Closes all open resources and releases the write lock.
   *
   * If {@link IndexWriterConfig#commitOnClose} is <code>true</code>,
   * this will attempt to gracefully shut down by writing any
   * changes, waiting for any running merges, committing, and closing.
   * In this case, note that:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>If you called prepareCommit but failed to call commit, this
   *       method will throw {@code IllegalStateException} and the {@code IndexWriter}
   *       will not be closed.</li>
   *   <li>If this method throws any other exception, the {@code IndexWriter}
   *       will be closed, but changes may have been lost.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>
   * Note that this may be a costly
   * operation, so, try to re-use a single writer instead of
   * closing and opening a new one.  See {@link #commit()} for
   * caveats about write caching done by some IO devices.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE</b>: You must ensure no other threads are still making
   * changes at the same time that this method is invoked.</p>
