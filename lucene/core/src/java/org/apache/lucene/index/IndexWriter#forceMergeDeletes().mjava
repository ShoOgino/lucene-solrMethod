  /**
   *  Forces merging of all segments that have deleted
   *  documents.  The actual merges to be executed are
   *  determined by the {@link MergePolicy}.  For example,
   *  the default {@link TieredMergePolicy} will only
   *  pick a segment if the percentage of
   *  deleted docs is over 10%.
   *
   *  <p>This is often a horribly costly operation; rarely
   *  is it warranted.</p>
   *
   *  <p>To see how
   *  many deletions you have pending in your index, call
   *  {@link IndexReader#numDeletedDocs}.</p>
   *
   *  <p><b>NOTE</b>: this method first flushes a new
   *  segment (if there are indexed documents), and applies
   *  all buffered deletes.
   *
   *  <p><b>NOTE</b>: if this method hits an OutOfMemoryError
   *  you should immediately close the writer.  See <a
   *  href="#OOME">above</a> for details.</p>
