   * Sets the termsIndexDivisor passed to any readers that IndexWriter opens,

   * terms index won't be loaded by the readers. This is only useful in advanced
   * situations when you will only .next() through all terms; attempts to seek
   * will hit an exception.
   *

   * Takes effect immediately, but only applies to readers opened after this
   * call

   * <b>NOTE:</b> divisor settings &gt; 1 do not apply to all PostingsFormat
   * implementations, including the default one in this release. It only makes
   * sense for terms indexes that can efficiently re-sample terms at load time.
