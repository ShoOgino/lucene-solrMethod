  /** Expert: Set the interval between indexed terms.  Large values cause less
   * memory to be used by IndexReader, but slow random-access to terms.  Small
   * values cause more memory to be used by an IndexReader, and speed
   * random-access to terms.
   *
   * This parameter determines the amount of computation required per query
   * term, regardless of the number of documents that contain that term.  In
   * particular, it is the maximum number of other terms that must be
   * scanned before a term is located and its frequency and position information
   * may be processed.  In a large index with user-entered query terms, query
   * processing time is likely to be dominated not by term lookup but rather
   * by the processing of frequency and positional data.  In a small index
   * or when many uncommon query terms are generated (e.g., by wildcard
   * queries) term lookup may become a dominant cost.
   *
   * In particular, <code>numUniqueTerms/interval</code> terms are read into
   * memory by an IndexReader, and, on average, <code>interval/2</code> terms
   * must be scanned for each random term access.
