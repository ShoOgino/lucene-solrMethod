  /**
   * Determines the amount of RAM that may be used for buffering added documents
   * and deletions before they are flushed to the Directory. Generally for
   * faster indexing performance it's best to flush by RAM usage instead of
   * document count and use as large a RAM buffer as you can.
   * 
   * <p>
   * When this is set, the writer will flush whenever buffered documents and
   * deletions use this much RAM. Pass in {@link #DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH} to prevent
   * triggering a flush due to RAM usage. Note that if flushing by document
   * count is also enabled, then the flush will be triggered by whichever comes
   * first.
   * 
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE</b>: the account of RAM usage for pending deletions is only
   * approximate. Specifically, if you delete by Query, Lucene currently has no
   * way to measure the RAM usage of individual Queries so the accounting will
   * under-estimate and you should compensate by either calling commit()
   * periodically yourself, or by using {@link #setMaxBufferedDeleteTerms(int)}
   * to flush by count instead of RAM usage (each buffered delete Query counts 
   * as one).
   * 
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE</b>: because IndexWriter uses <code>int</code>s when managing its
   * internal storage, the absolute maximum value for this setting is somewhat
   * less than 2048 MB. The precise limit depends on various factors, such as
   * how large your documents are, how many fields have norms, etc., so it's
   * best to set this value comfortably under 2048.
   * 
   * <p>
   * The default value is {@link #DEFAULT_RAM_BUFFER_SIZE_MB}.
   * 
   * <p>Takes effect immediately, but only the next time a
   * document is added, updated or deleted.
   *
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException
   *           if ramBufferSize is enabled but non-positive, or it disables
   *           ramBufferSize when maxBufferedDocs is already disabled
