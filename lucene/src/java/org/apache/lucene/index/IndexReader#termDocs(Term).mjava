  /** Returns an enumeration of all the documents which contain
   * <code>term</code>. For each document, the document number, the frequency of
   * the term in that document is also provided, for use in
   * search scoring.  If term is null, then all non-deleted
   * docs are returned with freq=1.
   * Thus, this method implements the mapping:
   * <p><ul>
   * Term &nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;docNum, freq&gt;<sup>*</sup>
   * </ul>
   * <p>The enumeration is ordered by document number.  Each document number
   * is greater than all that precede it in the enumeration.
   * @deprecated Use the new flex API ({@link #termDocsEnum}) instead.
   * @throws IOException if there is a low-level IO error
