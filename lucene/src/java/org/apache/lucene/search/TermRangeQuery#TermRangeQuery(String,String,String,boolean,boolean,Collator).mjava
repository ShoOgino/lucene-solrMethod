  /** Constructs a query selecting all terms greater/equal than
   * <code>lowerTerm</code> but less/equal than <code>upperTerm</code>.
   * <p>
   * If an endpoint is null, it is said 
   * to be "open". Either or both endpoints may be open.  Open endpoints may not 
   * be exclusive (you can't select all but the first or last term without 
   * explicitly specifying the term to exclude.)
   * <p>
   * If <code>collator</code> is not null, it will be used to decide whether
   * index terms are within the given range, rather than using the Unicode code
   * point order in which index terms are stored.
   * <p>
   * <strong>WARNING:</strong> Using this constructor and supplying a non-null
   * value in the <code>collator</code> parameter will cause every single 
   * index Term in the Field referenced by lowerTerm and/or upperTerm to be
   * examined.  Depending on the number of index Terms in this Field, the 
   * operation could be very slow.
   *
   * @param lowerTerm The Term text at the lower end of the range
   * @param upperTerm The Term text at the upper end of the range
   * @param includeLower
   *          If true, the <code>lowerTerm</code> is
   *          included in the range.
   * @param includeUpper
   *          If true, the <code>upperTerm</code> is
   *          included in the range.
   * @param collator The collator to use to collate index Terms, to determine
   *  their membership in the range bounded by <code>lowerTerm</code> and
   *  <code>upperTerm</code>.
