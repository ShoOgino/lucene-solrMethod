  /**
   * Expert: Return the number of unique terms visited during execution of the query.
   * If there are many of them, you may consider using another query type
   * or reduce your total term count in index.
   * <p>This method is not thread safe, be sure to only call it when no query is running!
   * If you re-use the same query instance for another
   * search, be sure to first reset the term counter
   * with {@link #clearTotalNumberOfTerms}.
   * <p>On single-segment indexes / no MultiReaders, you get the correct number of
   * unique terms for the whole index. Use this number to compare different queries.
   * For multi-segment indexes this number can also be achieved in
   * non-constant-score mode. In constant-score mode you get the total number of
   * terms seeked for all segments / sub-readers.
   * @see #clearTotalNumberOfTerms
