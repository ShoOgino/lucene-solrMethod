    /**
     * Init PhrasePositions in place.
     * There is a one time initialization for this scorer (taking place at the first doc that matches all terms):
     * <br>- Put in repeats[] each pp that has another pp with same position in the doc.
     *       This relies on that the position in PP is computed as (TP.position - offset) and 
     *       so by adding offset we actually compare positions and identify that the two are 
     *       the same term.
     *       An exclusion to this is two distinct terms in the same offset in query and same 
     *       position in doc. This case is detected by comparing just the (query) offsets, 
     *       and two such PPs are not considered "repeating". 
     * <br>- Also mark each such pp by pp.repeats = true.
     * <br>Later can consult with repeats[] in termPositionsConflict(pp), making that check efficient.
     * In particular, this allows to score queries with no repetitions with no overhead due to this computation.
     * <br>- Example 1 - query with no repetitions: "ho my"~2
     * <br>- Example 2 - query with repetitions: "ho my my"~2
     * <br>- Example 3 - query with repetitions: "my ho my"~2
     * <br>Init per doc w/repeats in query, includes propagating some repeating pp's to avoid false phrase detection.  
     * @return end (max position), or -1 if any term ran out (i.e. done) 
     * @throws IOException
