  /** Encodes a normalization factor for storage in an index.
   *
   * <p>The encoding uses a three-bit mantissa, a five-bit exponent, and
   * the zero-exponent point at 15, thus
   * representing values from around 7x10^9 to 2x10^-9 with about one
   * significant decimal digit of accuracy.  Zero is also represented.
   * Negative numbers are rounded up to zero.  Values too large to represent
   * are rounded down to the largest representable value.  Positive values too
   * small to represent are rounded up to the smallest positive representable
   * value.
   * <p>
   * <b>WARNING: If you override this method, you should change the default
   * Similarity to your implementation with {@link Similarity#setDefault(Similarity)}. 
   * Otherwise, your method may not always be called, especially if you omit norms 
   * for some fields.</b>
