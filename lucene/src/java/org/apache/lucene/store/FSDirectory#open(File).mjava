  /** Creates an FSDirectory instance, trying to pick the
   *  best implementation given the current environment.
   *  The directory returned uses the {@link NativeFSLockFactory}.
   *
   *  <p>Currently this returns {@link NIOFSDirectory}
   *  on non-Windows JREs, {@link MMapDirectory} on 64-bit 
   *  Sun Windows JREs, and {@link SimpleFSDirectory} for other
   *  JRes on Windows. It is highly recommended that you consult the
   *  implementation's documentation for your platform before
   *  using this method.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE</b>: this method may suddenly change which
   * implementation is returned from release to release, in
   * the event that higher performance defaults become
   * possible; if the precise implementation is important to
   * your application, please instantiate it directly,
   * instead. For optimal performance you should consider using
   * {@link MMapDirectory} on 64 bit JVMs.
   *
   * <p>See <a href="#subclasses">above</a> */
