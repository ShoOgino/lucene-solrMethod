   * Version number when this IndexReader was opened. Not
   * implemented in the IndexReader base class.
   *
   * <p>If this reader is based on a Directory (ie, was
   * created by calling {@link #open}, or {@link #reopen} on
   * a reader based on a Directory), then this method
   * returns the version recorded in the commit that the
   * reader opened.  This version is advanced every time
   * {@link IndexWriter#commit} is called.</p>
   *
   * <p>If instead this reader is a near real-time reader
   * (ie, obtained by a call to {@link
   * IndexWriter#getReader}, or by calling {@link #reopen}
   * on a near real-time reader), then this method returns
   * the version of the last commit done by the writer.
   * Note that even as further changes are made with the
   * writer, the version will not changed until a commit is
   * completed.  Thus, you should not rely on this method to
   * determine when a near real-time reader should be
   * opened.  Use {@link #isCurrent} instead.</p>
