   * For definition of "check point" see IndexWriter comments:

   * Writer calls this when it has made a "consistent
   * change" to the index, meaning new files are written to
   * the index and the in-memory SegmentInfos have been
   * modified to point to those files.
   *
   * This may or may not be a commit (segments_N may or may
   * not have been written).
   *
   * We simply incref the files referenced by the new
   * SegmentInfos and decref the files we had previously
   * seen (if any).
   *
   * If this is a commit, we also call the policy to give it
   * a chance to remove other commits.  If any commits are
   * removed, we decref their files as well.
