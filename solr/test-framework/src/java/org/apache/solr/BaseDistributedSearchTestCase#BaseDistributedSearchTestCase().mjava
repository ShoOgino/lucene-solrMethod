   * Constructs a test in which the jetty+solr instances as well as the

   * <p>
   * If the system property is not set, or is set to the empty string 
   * (neither of which should normally happen unless a subclass explicitly 
   * modifies the property set by {@link #initHostContext} prior to calling 
   * this constructor) a servlet context of "/solr" is used. (this is for 
   * consistency with the default behavior of solr.xml parsing when using 
   * <code>hostContext="${hostContext:}"</code>
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * If the system property is set to a value which does not begin with a 
   * "/" (which should normally happen unless a subclass explicitly 
   * modifies the property set by {@link #initHostContext} prior to calling 
   * this constructor) a leading "/" will be prepended.
   * </p>
