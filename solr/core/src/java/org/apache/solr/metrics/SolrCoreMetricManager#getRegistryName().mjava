  /**
   * Metric registry name of the manager.
   *
   * In order to make it easier for reporting tools to aggregate metrics from
   * different cores that logically belong to a single collection we convert the
   * core name into a dot-separated hierarchy of: collection name, shard name (with optional split)
   * and replica name.
   *
   * <p>For example, when the core name looks like this but it's NOT a SolrCloud collection:
   * <code>my_collection_shard1_1_replica1</code> then this will be used as the registry name (plus
   * the required <code>solr.core</code> prefix). However,
   * if this is a SolrCloud collection <code>my_collection</code> then the registry name will become
   * <code>solr.core.my_collection.shard1_1.replica1</code>.</p>
   *
   *
   * @return the metric registry name of the manager.
