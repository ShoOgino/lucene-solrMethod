  /**
   * Returns a Query instance for doing range searches on this field type. {@link org.apache.solr.search.SolrQueryParser}
   * currently passes part1 and part2 as null if they are '*' respectively. minInclusive and maxInclusive are both true
   * currently by SolrQueryParser but that may change in the future. Also, other QueryParser implementations may have
   * different semantics.
   * <p>
   * If the field has docValues enabled, and the range query has '*'s or nulls on either side, then a {@link org.apache.lucene.search.DocValuesFieldExistsQuery} is returned.
   *
   * Sub-classes should override the "getSpecializedRangeQuery" method to provide their own range query implementation. They should strive to
   * handle nulls in part1 and/or part2 as well as unequal minInclusive and maxInclusive parameters gracefully.

   * @param part2        the upper boundary of the range, nulls are allowed
