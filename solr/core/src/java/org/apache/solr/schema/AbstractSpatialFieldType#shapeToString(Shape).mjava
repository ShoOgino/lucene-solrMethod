   * Returns a String version of a shape to be used for the stored value. This method in Solr is only called if for some
   * reason a Shape object is passed to the field type (perhaps via a custom UpdateRequestProcessor),
   * *and* the field is marked as stored.  <em>The default implementation throws an exception.</em>
   * <p/>
   * Spatial4j 0.4 is probably the last release to support SpatialContext.toString(shape) but it's deprecated with no
   * planned replacement.  Shapes do have a toString() method but they are generally internal/diagnostic and not
   * standard WKT.
   * The solution is subclassing and calling ctx.toString(shape) or directly using LegacyShapeReadWriterFormat or
   * passing in some sort of custom wrapped shape that holds a reference to a String or can generate it.
