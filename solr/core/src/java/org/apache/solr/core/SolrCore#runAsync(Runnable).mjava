  /**
   * Run an arbitrary task in it's own thread. This is an expert option and is
   * a method you should use with great care. It would be bad to run something that never stopped
   * or run something that took a very long time. Typically this is intended for actions that take
   * a few seconds, and therefore would be bad to wait for within a request, but but would not pose
   * a significant hindrance to server shut down times. It is not intended for long running tasks
   * and if you are using a Runnable with a loop in it, you are almost certainly doing it wrong.
   * <p>
   * WARNING: Solr wil not be able to shut down gracefully until this task completes!
   * <p>
   * A significant upside of using this method vs creating your own ExecutorService is that your code
   * does not have to properly shutdown executors which typically is risky from a unit testing
   * perspective since the test framework will complain if you don't carefully ensure the executor
   * shuts down before the end of the test. Also the threads running this task are sure to have
   * a proper MDC for logging.
   *
   * @param r the task to run
