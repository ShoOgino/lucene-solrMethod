   * Returns an immutable Map of Exceptions that occurred when initializing
   * SolrCores (either at startup, or do to runtime requests to create cores)
   * keyed off of the name (String) of the SolrCore that had the Exception
   * during initialization.
   * <p>
   * While the Map returned by this method is immutable and will not change
   * once returned to the client, the source data used to generate this Map
   * can be changed as various SolrCore operations are performed:
   * </p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>Failed attempts to create new SolrCores will add new Exceptions.</li>
   * <li>Failed attempts to re-create a SolrCore using a name already contained in this Map will replace the Exception.</li>
   * <li>Failed attempts to reload a SolrCore will cause an Exception to be added to this list -- even though the existing SolrCore with that name will continue to be available.</li>
   * <li>Successful attempts to re-created a SolrCore using a name already contained in this Map will remove the Exception.</li>
   * <li>Registering an existing SolrCore with a name already contained in this Map (ie: ALIAS or SWAP) will remove the Exception.</li>
   * </ul>
