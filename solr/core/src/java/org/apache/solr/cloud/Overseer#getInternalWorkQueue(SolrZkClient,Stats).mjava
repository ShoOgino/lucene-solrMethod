  /**
   * Internal overseer work queue. This should not be used outside of Overseer.
   * <p>
   * This queue is used to store overseer operations that have been removed from the
   * state update queue but are being executed as part of a batch. Once
   * the result of the batch is persisted to zookeeper, these items are removed from the
   * work queue. If the overseer dies while processing a batch then a new overseer always
   * operates from the work queue first and only then starts processing operations from the
   * state update queue.
   * This method will create the /overseer znode in ZooKeeper if it does not exist already.
   *
   * @param zkClient the {@link SolrZkClient} to be used for reading/writing to the queue
   * @param zkStats  a {@link Overseer.Stats} object which tracks statistics for all zookeeper operations performed by this queue
   * @return a {@link ZkDistributedQueue} object
