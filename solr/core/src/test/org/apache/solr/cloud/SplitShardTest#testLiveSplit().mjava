    // until you get another failure.
    // You may need to further instrument things like DistributedZkUpdateProcessor to display the cluster state for the collection, etc.
    // Using more threads increases the chance to hit a concurrency bug, but too many threads can overwhelm single-threaded buffering
    // replay after the low level index split and result in subShard leaders that can't catch up and
    // become active (a known issue that still needs to be resolved.)
