    // 1. it will fail to initialize if it doesn't find a 2 line CSV like foo,bar\nbaz,bam thus validating
    //    that we are properly pulling data from the blob store
    // 2. It replaces any q for a query request to /select with "text:<name>" where <name> is the name
    //    of the last collection to run a query. It does this by caching a shared resource of type
    //    ResourceSharingTestComponent.TestObject, and the following sequence is proof that either
    //    collection can tell if it was (or was not) the last collection to issue a query by 
    //    consulting the shared object
