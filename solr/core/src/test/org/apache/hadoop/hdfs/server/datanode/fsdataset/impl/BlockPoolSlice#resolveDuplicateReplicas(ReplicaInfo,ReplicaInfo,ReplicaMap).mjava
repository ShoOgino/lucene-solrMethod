   * This method is invoked during DN startup when volumes are scanned to

   *
   * Given two replicas, decide which one to keep. The preference is as
   * follows:
   *   1. Prefer the replica with the higher generation stamp.
   *   2. If generation stamps are equal, prefer the replica with the
   *      larger on-disk length.
   *   3. If on-disk length is the same, prefer the replica on persistent
   *      storage volume.
   *   4. All other factors being equal, keep replica1.
   *
   * The other replica is removed from the volumeMap and is deleted from
   * its storage volume.
   *
   * @param replica1 first replica
   * @param replica2 second replica
   * @param volumeMap volume map to update
   * @return the replica that is retained.
