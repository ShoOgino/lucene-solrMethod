   * A constructor called with a '|' separated list of path expressions

   * separate records.
   *
   * @param splitPath The PATH for which a record is emitted. Once the
   *                  path tag is encountered, the Node.getInst method starts collecting wanted
   *                  fields and at the close of the tag, a record is emitted containing all
   *                  fields collected since the tag start. Once
   *                  emitted the collected fields are cleared. Any fields collected in the
   *                  parent tag or above will also be included in the record, but these are
   *                  not cleared after emitting the record.
   *                  <p/>
   *                  It uses the ' | ' syntax of PATH to pass in multiple paths.
