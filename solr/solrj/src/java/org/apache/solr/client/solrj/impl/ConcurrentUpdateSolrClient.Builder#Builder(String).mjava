     * Create a Builder object, based on the provided Solr URL.
     * 
     * Two different paths can be specified as a part of this URL:
     * 
     * 1) A path pointing directly at a particular core
     * <pre>
     *   SolrClient client = new ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient.Builder("http://my-solr-server:8983/solr/core1").build();
     *   QueryResponse resp = client.query(new SolrQuery("*:*"));
     * </pre>
     * Note that when a core is provided in the base URL, queries and other requests can be made without mentioning the
     * core explicitly.  However, the client can only send requests to that core.
     * 
     * 2) The path of the root Solr path ("/solr")
     * <pre>
     *   SolrClient client = new ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient.Builder("http://my-solr-server:8983/solr").build();
     *   QueryResponse resp = client.query("core1", new SolrQuery("*:*"));
     * </pre>
     * In this case the client is more flexible and can be used to send requests to any cores.  This flexibility though
     * requires that the core be specified on all requests.
