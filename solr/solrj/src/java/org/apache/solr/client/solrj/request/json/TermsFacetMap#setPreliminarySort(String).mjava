  /**
   * Indicates an approximate sort calculation to be performed during initial bucket generation and collection.
   *
   * Values can be based on 'count' (the number of results in each bucket), 'index' (the natural order of bucket values),
   * or on any stat facet that occurs in the bucket.  Defaults to "count desc" if not specified.
   *
   * When no {@code prelim_sort} is provided, {@code sort} is calculated on all buckets generated by all shards.  If
   * {@code sort} is expensive, {@code prelim_sort} can be used to provide a cheaper approximation calculation that is
   * run instead on initial bucket collection.  {@code sort} is still used when assembling the final list of buckets.
