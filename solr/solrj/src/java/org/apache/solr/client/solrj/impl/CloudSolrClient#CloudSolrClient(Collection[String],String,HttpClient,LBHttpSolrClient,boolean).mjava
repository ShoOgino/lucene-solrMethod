  /**
   * Create a new client object that connects to Zookeeper and is always aware
   * of the SolrCloud state. If there is a fully redundant Zookeeper quorum and
   * SolrCloud has enough replicas for every shard in a collection, there is no
   * single point of failure. Updates will be sent to shard leaders by default.
   * 
   * @param zkHosts
   *          A Java Collection (List, Set, etc) of HOST:PORT strings, one for
   *          each host in the zookeeper ensemble. Note that with certain
   *          Collection types like HashSet, the order of hosts in the final
   *          connect string may not be in the same order you added them.
   * @param chroot
   *          A chroot value for zookeeper, starting with a forward slash. If no
   *          chroot is required, use null.
   * @param httpClient
   *          the {@link HttpClient} instance to be used for all requests. The provided httpClient should use a
   *          multi-threaded connection manager.  If null, a default HttpClient will be used.
   * @param lbSolrClient
   *          LBHttpSolrClient instance for requests.  If null, a default LBHttpSolrClient will be used.
   * @param updatesToLeaders
   *          If true, sends updates to shard leaders.
   *
   * @deprecated use {@link Builder} instead.  This will soon be a protected method, and will only
   * be available for use in implementing subclasses.
