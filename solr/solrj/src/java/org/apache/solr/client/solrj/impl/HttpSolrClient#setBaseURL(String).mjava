  /**
   * Change the base-url used when sending requests to Solr.
   * 
   * Two different paths can be specified as a part of this URL:
   * 
   * 1) A path pointing directly at a particular core
   * <pre>
   *   httpSolrClient.setBaseURL("http://my-solr-server:8983/solr/core1");
   *   QueryResponse resp = httpSolrClient.query(new SolrQuery("*:*"));
   * </pre>
   * Note that when a core is provided in the base URL, queries and other requests can be made without mentioning the
   * core explicitly.  However, the client can only send requests to that core.
   * 
   * 2) The path of the root Solr path ("/solr")
   * <pre>
   *   httpSolrClient.setBaseURL("http://my-solr-server:8983/solr");
   *   QueryResponse resp = httpSolrClient.query("core1", new SolrQuery("*:*"));
   * </pre>
   * In this case the client is more flexible and can be used to send requests to any cores.  The cost of this is that
   * the core must be specified on each request.
