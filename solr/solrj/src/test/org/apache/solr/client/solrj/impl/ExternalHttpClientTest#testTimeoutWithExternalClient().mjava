   * The internal client created by HttpSolrServer is a SystemDefaultHttpClient

   * the logic in InternalHttpClient.executeMethod replaces the configured defaults
   * by request level params if they exist. That is why we must test a setting such
   * as timeout with an external client to assert that the defaults are indeed being
