  /**
   * Factory method for generating a query (similar to
   * ({@link #getWildcardQuery}). Called when parser parses an input term
   * token that uses prefix notation; that is, contains a single '*' wildcard
   * character as its last character. Since this is a special case
   * of generic wildcard term, and such a query can be optimized easily,
   * this usually results in a different query object.
   *<p>
   * Depending on settings, a prefix term may be lower-cased
   * automatically. It will not go through the default Analyzer,
   * however, since normal Analyzers are unlikely to work properly
   * with wildcard templates.
   *<p>
   * Can be overridden by extending classes, to provide custom handling for
   * wild card queries, which may be necessary due to missing analyzer calls.
   *
   * @param field Name of the field query will use.
   * @param termStr Term token to use for building term for the query
   *    (<b>without</b> trailing '*' character!)
   *
   * @return Resulting {@link Query} built for the term
