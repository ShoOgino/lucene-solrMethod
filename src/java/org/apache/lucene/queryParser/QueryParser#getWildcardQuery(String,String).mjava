   * Factory method for generating a query. Called when parser
   * parses an input term token that contains one or more wildcard
   * characters (? and *), but is not a prefix term token (one
   * that has just a single * character at the end)
   *<p>
   * Depending on settings, prefix term may be lower-cased
   * automatically. It will not go through the default Analyzer,
   * however, since normal Analyzers are unlikely to work properly
   * with wildcard templates.
   *<p>
   * Can be overridden by extending classes, to provide custom handling for
   * wildcard queries, which may be necessary due to missing analyzer calls.
   *
   * @param field Name of the field query will use.
   * @param termStr Term token that contains one or more wild card
   *   characters (? or *), but is not simple prefix term
   *
   * @return Resulting {@link Query} built for the term
   * @exception ParseException throw in overridden method to disallow
