   * significant decimal digit of accuracy.  Zero is also represented.
   * Negative numbers are rounded up to zero.  Values too large to represent
   * are rounded down to the largest representable value.  Positive values too
   * small to represent are rounded up to the smallest positive representable
   * value.
