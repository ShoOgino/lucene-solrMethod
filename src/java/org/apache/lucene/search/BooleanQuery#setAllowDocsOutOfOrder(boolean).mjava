  /**
   * Expert: Indicates whether hit docs may be collected out of docid order.
   * 
   * <p>
   * Background: although the contract of the Scorer class requires that
   * documents be iterated in order of doc id, this was not true in early
   * versions of Lucene. Many pieces of functionality in the current Lucene code
   * base have undefined behavior if this contract is not upheld, but in some
   * specific simple cases may be faster. (For example: disjunction queries with
   * less than 32 prohibited clauses; This setting has no effect for other
   * queries.)
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * Specifics: By setting this option to true, docid N might be scored for a
   * single segment before docid N-1. Across multiple segments, docs may be
   * scored out of order regardless of this setting - it only applies to scoring
   * a single segment.
   * 
   * Being static, this setting is system wide.
   * </p>
   * 
   * @deprecated this is not needed anymore, as
   *             {@link Weight#scoresDocsOutOfOrder()} is used.
