  /**
   * Expert: Indicates whether hit docs may be collected out of docid
   * order.
   *
   * <p>
   * Background: llthough the contract of the Scorer class requires that
   * documents be iterated in order of doc id this was not true in early
   * versions of Lucene.  Many pieces of functionality in the current
   * Lucene code base have undefined behavior if this contract is not
   * upheld, but in some specific simple cases may be faster.  (For
   * example: disjunction queries with less than 32 prohibited clauses;
   * This setting has no effect for other queries.)
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * Specifics: By setting this option to this true, calls to 
   * {@link HitCollector#collect(int,float)} might be
   * invoked first for docid N and only later for docid N-1.
   * Being static, this setting is system wide.
   * </p>
