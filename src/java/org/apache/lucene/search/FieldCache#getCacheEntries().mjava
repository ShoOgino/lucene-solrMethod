   * EXPERT: Generates an array of CacheEntry objects representing all items

   * <p>
   * NOTE: These CacheEntry objects maintain a strong reference to the 
   * Cached Values.  Maintaining references to a CacheEntry the IndexReader 
   * associated with it has garbage collected will prevent the Value itself
   * from being garbage collected when the Cache drops the WeakReference.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * <b>EXPERIMENTAL API:</b> This API is considered extremely advanced 
   * and experimental.  It may be removed or altered w/o warning in future 
   * releases 
   * of Lucene.
