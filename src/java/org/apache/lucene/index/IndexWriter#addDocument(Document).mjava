  /**
   * Adds a document to this index.  If the document contains more than
   * {@link #setMaxFieldLength(int)} terms for a given field, the remainder are
   * discarded.
   *
   * <p> Note that if an Exception is hit (for example disk full)
   * then the index will be consistent, but this document
   * may not have been added.  Furthermore, it's possible
   * the index will have one segment in non-compound format
   * even when using compound files (when a merge has
   * partially succeeded).</p>
   *
   * <p> This method periodically flushes pending documents
   * to the Directory (every {@link #setMaxBufferedDocs}),
   * and also periodically merges segments in the index
   * (every {@link #setMergeFactor} flushes).  When this
   * occurs, the method will take more time to run (possibly
   * a long time if the index is large), and will require
   * free temporary space in the Directory to do the
   * merging.</p>
   *
   * <p>The amount of free space required when a merge is
   * triggered is up to 1X the size of all segments being
   * merged, when no readers/searchers are open against the
   * index, and up to 2X the size of all segments being
   * merged when readers/searchers are open against the
   * index (see {@link #optimize()} for details).  Most
   * merges are small (merging the smallest segments
   * together), but whenever a full merge occurs (all
   * segments in the index, which is the worst case for
   * temporary space usage) then the maximum free disk space
   * required is the same as {@link #optimize}.</p>
