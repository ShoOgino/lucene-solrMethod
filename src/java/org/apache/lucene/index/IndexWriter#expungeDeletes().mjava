  /** Expunges all deletes from the index.  When an index
   *  has many document deletions (or updates to existing
   *  documents), it's best to either call optimize or
   *  expungeDeletes to remove all unused data in the index
   *  associated with the deleted documents.  To see how
   *  many deletions you have pending in your index, call
   *  {@link IndexReader#maxDoc - IndexReader#numDocs}.
   *  This saves disk space and memory usage while
   *  searching.  expungeDeletes should be somewhat faster
   *  than optimize since it does not insist on reducing the
   *  index to a single segment (though, this depends on the
   *  {@link MergePolicy}; see {@link
   *  MergePolicy#findMergesToExpungeDeletes}.). Note that
   *  this call does not first commit any buffered
   *  documents, so you must do so yourself if necessary.
   *  See also {@link #expungeDeletes(boolean)} */
