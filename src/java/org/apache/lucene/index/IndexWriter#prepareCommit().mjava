  /** <p>Expert: prepare for commit.  This does the first
   *  phase of 2-phase commit.  You can only call this when
   *  autoCommit is false.  This method does all steps
   *  necessary to commit changes since this writer was
   *  opened: flushes pending added and deleted docs, syncs
   *  the index files, writes most of next segments_N file.
   *  After calling this you must call either {@link
   *  #commit()} to finish the commit, or {@link
   *  #rollback()} to revert the commit and undo all changes
   *  done since the writer was opened.</p>
   *
   * You can also just call {@link #commit()} directly
   * without prepareCommit first in which case that method
   * will internally call prepareCommit.
