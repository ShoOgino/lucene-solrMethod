  /**
   * The maximum number of terms that will be indexed for a single field in a
   * document.  This limits the amount of memory required for indexing, so that
   * collections with very large files will not crash the indexing process by
   * running out of memory.  This setting refers to the number of running terms,
   * not to the number of different terms.<p/>
   * <strong>Note:</strong> this silently truncates large documents, excluding from the
   * index all terms that occur further in the document.  If you know your source
   * documents are large, be sure to set this value high enough to accomodate
   * the expected size.  If you set it to Integer.MAX_VALUE, then the only limit
   * is your memory, but you should anticipate an OutOfMemoryError.<p/>
   * By default, no more than 10,000 terms will be indexed for a field.
