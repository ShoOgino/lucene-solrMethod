  /** Expert: returns the sequential sub readers that this
   *  reader is logically composed of.  For example,
   *  IndexSearcher uses this API to drive searching by one
   *  sub reader at a time.  If this reader is not composed
   *  of sequential child readers, it should return null.
   *  If this method returns an empty array, that means this
   *  reader is a null reader (for example a MultiReader
   *  that has no sub readers).
   *  <p>
   *  NOTE: for a MultiSegmentReader, which is obtained by
   *  {@link #open} when the index has more than one
   *  segment, you should not use the sub-readers returned
   *  by this method to make any changes (setNorm,
   *  deleteDocument, etc.).  Doing so will likely lead to
   *  index corruption.  Use the parent reader instead. */
