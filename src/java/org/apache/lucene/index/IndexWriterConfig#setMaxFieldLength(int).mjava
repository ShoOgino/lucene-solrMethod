   * The maximum number of terms that will be indexed for a single field in a
   * document. This limits the amount of memory required for indexing, so that
   * collections with very large files will not crash the indexing process by
   * running out of memory. This setting refers to the number of running terms,
   * not to the number of different terms.
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE:</b> this silently truncates large documents, excluding from the
   * index all terms that occur further in the document. If you know your source
   * documents are large, be sure to set this value high enough to accomodate
   * the expected size. If you set it to {@link #UNLIMITED_FIELD_LENGTH}, then
   * the only limit is your memory, but you should anticipate an
   * OutOfMemoryError.
   * <p>
   * By default it is set to {@link #UNLIMITED_FIELD_LENGTH}.
