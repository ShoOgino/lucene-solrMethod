   * i.e. the "front index state". Be careful not to delete it,
   * unless you know for sure what you are doing, and unless 
   * you can afford to lose the index content while doing that.

   * {@link IndexCommitPoint point-in-time commits},
   *  sorted by age (the 0th one is the oldest commit).
