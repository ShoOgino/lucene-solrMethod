   * <p>This is called each time the writer completed a commit.
   * This gives the policy a chance to remove old commit points

   *
   * <p>The policy may now choose to delete old commit points 
   * by calling method {@link IndexCommit#delete delete()}

   * 
   * <p>If writer has <code>autoCommit = true</code> then
   * this method will in general be called many times during
   * one instance of {@link IndexWriter}.  If
   * <code>autoCommit = false</code> then this method is
   * only called once when {@link IndexWriter#close} is
   * called, or not at all if the {@link IndexWriter#abort}
   * is called. 
   *
   * <p><u>Note:</u> the last CommitPoint is the most recent one,
   * i.e. the "front index state". Be careful not to delete it,
   * unless you know for sure what you are doing, and unless 
   * you can afford to lose the index content while doing that.
   *  
   * @param commits List of {@link IndexCommit},
   *  sorted by age (the 0th one is the oldest commit).
