  /**
   * Flushes all changes to an index and closes all
   * associated files.
   *
   * <p> If an Exception is hit during close, eg due to disk
   * full or some other reason, then both the on-disk index
   * and the internal state of the IndexWriter instance will
   * be consistent.  However, the close will not be complete
   * even though part of it (flushing buffered documents)
   * may have succeeded, so the write lock will still be
   * held.</p>
   * 
   * <p> If you can correct the underlying cause (eg free up
   * some disk space) then you can call close() again.
   * Failing that, if you want to force the write lock to be
   * released (dangerous, because you may then lose buffered
   * docs in the IndexWriter instance) then you can do
   * something like this:</p>
   *
   * <pre>
   * try {
   *   writer.close();
   * } finally {
   *   if (IndexReader.isLocked(directory)) {
   *     IndexReader.unlock(directory);
   *   }
   * }
   * </pre>
   *
   * after which, you must be certain not to use the writer
   * instance anymore.</p>
   * @throws CorruptIndexException if the index is corrupt
   * @throws IOException if there is a low-level IO error
