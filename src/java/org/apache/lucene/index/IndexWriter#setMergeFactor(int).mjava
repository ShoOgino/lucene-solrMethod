  /** Determines how often segment indices are merged by addDocument().  With
   * smaller values, less RAM is used while indexing, and searches on

   * values, more RAM is used during indexing, and while searches on unoptimized
   * indices are slower, indexing is faster.  Thus larger values (> 10) are best
   * for batch index creation, and smaller values (< 10) for indices that are
