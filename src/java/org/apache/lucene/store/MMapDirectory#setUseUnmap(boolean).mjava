   * an undocumented internal cleanup functionality.

   * by Java and may lead to JVM crashs if <code>IndexInput</code>
   * is closed while another thread is still accessing it (SIGSEGV).
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@link #UNMAP_SUPPORTED}
   * is <code>false</code> and the workaround cannot be enabled.
