  /** Set the position increment.  This determines the position of this token
   * relative to the previous Token in a {@link TokenStream}, used in phrase
   * searching.
   *
   * <p>The default value is one.
   *
   * <p>Two common uses for this are:<ul>
   *
   * <li>Set it to zero to put multiple terms in the same position.  This is
   * useful if, e.g., when a word has multiple stems.  This way searches for
   * phrases including either stem will match this occurence.  In this case,
   * all but the first stem's increment should be set to zero: the increment of
   * the first instance should be one.
   *
   * <li>Set it to values greater than one to inhibit exact phrase matches.
   * If, for example, one does not want phrases to match across stop words,
   * then one could build a stop word filter that removes stop words and also
   * sets the increment to the number of stop words removed before each
   * non-stop word.
   *
   * </ul>
