   * For extra performance you can globally enable the new {@link #incrementToken}

   * increase by enabling this, but it only works if <b>all</b> TokenStreams and -Filters
   * use the new API and implement {@link #incrementToken}. This setting can only be enabled
   * globally.
   * <P>This setting only affects TokenStreams instantiated after this call. All TokenStreams
   * already created use the other setting.
   * <P>All core analyzers are compatible with this setting, if you have own
   * TokenStreams/-Filters, that are also compatible, enable this.
   * <P>When enabled, tokenization may throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}s,
   * if the whole tokenizer chain is not compatible.
   * <P>The default is <code>false</code>, so there is the fallback to the old API available.
   * @deprecated This setting will be <code>true</code> per default in Lucene 3.0,
   * when {@link #incrementToken} is abstract and must be always implemented.
