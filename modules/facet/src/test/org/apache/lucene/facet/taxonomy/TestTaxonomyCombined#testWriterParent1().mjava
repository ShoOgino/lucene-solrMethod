  /**
   * Tests for TaxonomyWriter's getParent() method. We check it by comparing
   * its results to those we could have gotten by looking at the category
   * string paths using a TaxonomyReader (where the parentage is obvious).
   * Note that after testReaderBasic(), we already know we can trust the
   * ordinal <=> category conversions from TaxonomyReader.
   *
   * The difference between testWriterParent1 and testWriterParent2 is that
   * the former closes the taxonomy writer before reopening it, while the
   * latter does not.
   * 
   * This test code is virtually identical to that of testReaderParent().
