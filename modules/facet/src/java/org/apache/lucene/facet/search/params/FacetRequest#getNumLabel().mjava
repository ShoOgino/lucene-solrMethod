   * If getNumLabel()<getNumResults(), only the first getNumLabel() results
   * will have their category paths calculated, and the rest will only be
   * available as ordinals (category numbers) and will have null paths.
   * <P>
   * If Integer.MAX_VALUE is specified, all 
   * results are labled.
   * <P>
   * The purpose of this parameter is to avoid having to run the whole
   * faceted search again when the user asks for more values for the facet;
   * The application can ask (getNumResults()) for more values than it needs
   * to show, but keep getNumLabel() only the number it wants to immediately
   * show. The slow-down caused by finding more values is negligible, because
   * the slowest part - finding the categories' paths, is avoided.
   * <p>
   * Depending on the {@link #getResultMode() LimitsMode},
   * this limit is applied globally or per results node.
   * In the global mode, if this limit is 3, 
   * only 3 top results would be labeled.
   * In the per-node mode, if this limit is 3,
   * 3 top children of {@link #getCategoryPath() the target category} would be labeled,
   * as well as 3 top children of each of them, and so forth, until the depth defined 
   * by {@link #getDepth()}.
   * @see #getResultMode()
