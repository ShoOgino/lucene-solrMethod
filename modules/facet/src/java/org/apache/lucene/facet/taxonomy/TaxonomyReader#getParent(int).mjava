  /**
   * getParent() returns the ordinal of the parent category of the category
   * with the given ordinal.
   * <P>
   * When a category is specified as a path name, finding the path of its
   * parent is as trivial as dropping the last component of the path.
   * getParent() is functionally equivalent to calling getPath() on the
   * given ordinal, dropping the last component of the path, and then calling
   * getOrdinal() to get an ordinal back. However, implementations are
   * expected to provide a much more efficient implementation:
   * <P>
   * getParent() should be a very quick method, as it is used during the
   * facet aggregation process in faceted search. Implementations will most
   * likely want to serve replies to this method from a pre-filled cache.
   * <P>
   * If the given ordinal is the ROOT_ORDINAL, an INVALID_ORDINAL is returned.
   * If the given ordinal is a top-level category, the ROOT_ORDINAL is returned.
   * If an invalid ordinal is given (negative or beyond the last available
   * ordinal), an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. However, it is
   * expected that getParent will only be called for ordinals which are
   * already known to be in the taxonomy.
