	 * Thai numeric tokens are typed as <ALPHANUM> instead of <NUM>.
	 * This is really a problem with the interaction w/ StandardTokenizer, which is used by ThaiAnalyzer.
	 * 
	 * The issue is this: in StandardTokenizer the entire [:Thai:] block is specified in ALPHANUM (including punctuation, digits, etc)
	 * Fix is easy: refine this spec to exclude thai punctuation and digits.
	 * 
	 * A better fix, that would also fix quite a few other languages would be to remove the thai hack.
	 * Instead, allow the definition of alphanum to include relevant categories like nonspacing marks!
