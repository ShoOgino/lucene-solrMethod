  /**
   * Suggest similar words (optionally restricted to a field of an index).
   * 
   * <p>As the Lucene similarity that is used to fetch the most relevant n-grammed terms
   * is not the same as the edit distance strategy used to calculate the best
   * matching spell-checked word from the hits that Lucene found, one usually has
   * to retrieve a couple of numSug's in order to get the true best match.
   *
   * <p>I.e. if numSug == 1, don't count on that suggestion being the best one.
   * Thus, you should set this value to <b>at least</b> 5 for a good suggestion.
   *
   * <p>Uses the {@link #getAccuracy()} value passed into the constructor as the accuracy.
   *
   * @param word the word you want a spell check done on
   * @param numSug the number of suggested words
   * @param ir the indexReader of the user index (can be null see field param)
   * @param field the field of the user index: if field is not null, the suggested
   * words are restricted to the words present in this field.
   * @param morePopular return only the suggest words that are as frequent or more frequent than the searched word
   * (only if restricted mode = (indexReader!=null and field!=null)
   * @throws IOException if the underlying index throws an {@link IOException}
   * @throws AlreadyClosedException if the Spellchecker is already closed
   * @return String[] the sorted list of the suggest words with these 2 criteria:
   * first criteria: the edit distance, second criteria (only if restricted mode): the popularity
   * of the suggest words in the field of the user index
