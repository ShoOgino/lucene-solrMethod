     * Reads all the response data into a byte array. Note that this method

     * instance don't invoke this method if the server is doing a server push).
     * If <code>getInputStream()</code> had been previously invoked then this

     *     System.out.println("The data: " + resp.getText())
     *</PRE> instead.

     * @exception IOException      If any io exception occured while reading the
     *      data
     * @exception ModuleException  if any module encounters an exception.
